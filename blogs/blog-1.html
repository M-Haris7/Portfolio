<blockquote>
<p><em>Thoughts about the nature of contemporary discourse over AI Implications relating to and for humans.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s not often that you find the frontrunners of a revolution (to borrow a pundit phrase) stepping away from the wagon they've been towing for years, now attempting to slow it down in rather public settings.</p>
<h2 id="the-zeitgeist">The Zeitgeist</h2>
<p>First things first, there’s a lot of nuance to the topic, it’s not new at its core, and people have been debating the possibility as well as the implications of such entities for centuries. What is new is the apparent or possible existence of them in the form the complex AI systems.</p>
<p>The question of there being equivalent agents with intelligence at par or even surpassing human intelligence is not new, religions, for instance, have a lot of them, be it Shaytan (satan), Angels, or Jinns, and their equivalents from other Abrahamic or non-Abrahamic faiths. Though rooted in strictly naturalistic assumptions about the nature of reality, AI seems to be the next best candidate for the vacancy. <p> 
<p>If I, somehow haven’t got your eyes rolled and lost my credibility before even saying anything, all just by referencing religion, God bless you.</p>
<p>Contemporary zeitgeist is a spectrum of positions, <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/ai-doomsday-scenarios-and-how-to-guard-against-them/">some</a> seem to take the “AI has the potential for good for humans, it should be done cautiously, but don’t regulate it” position, sounds reductionist ?, ik, however, I’d argue this is the core philosophy, which I don’t find convincing at all, more on this in later blogs.</p>
<p><a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/why-neural-net-pioneer-geoffrey-hinton-sounding-alarm-ai">Some</a> seem to take a more cautionary approach, often done injustice by doomsday headline articles, on a deeper reading though, this is unlike what I have read people on LinkedIn handwave as <em>“doomers”</em>, folks in this camp don’t exactly advocate for an AI halt, rather it’s more about a wager I think, an informed one, but a wager nevertheless.</p>
