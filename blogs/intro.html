<li>
<p><strong>Who</strong><br>
I am an AI-ML enthusiast, currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I am deeply passionate about technology, humans, and technology for humans. I am from a small village in Allahabad, U.P, India.<br>
I have lived across 5 states, currently living in Bengaluru, working as an MLE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Why</strong><br>
I have been active on social media in an on-off fashion, right now I am active on LinkedIn, and I see people putting their hot cum lukewarm takes on display and getting no push_back() at all. I am interested in diverse subjects, like Theology, Philosophy, Logic, and Maths among other technical and non-technical subjects. As such, I have opinions on things, and being reasonable in settings like LinkedIn, Reddit or other platforms is not just tough, it’s almost daunting. That’s <em>why</em> I need a blog, as a normie, I agree with people and I disagree with people, and I like having dialogue with both.</p>
<br>
Not to say I am not wrong, rather I can be very wrong, very often. Thats fun though, we can be educated together.
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What</strong><br>
What will I write about? I don’t really know, it’s not going to be strictly technical though, there are people who are better (that’s a low bar I agree) than me for that. As far as ML/AI is concerned, I love all of it, I believe them to be complex, spectacular  yet purely statistical systems unlike human agents (hot take ?), however, there are way too many over-arching opinions, and zeitgeist that I seriously disagree with. <br>
  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>My Interests</strong><br>
Subjects that I am particularly fond of :</p>
<ul>
<li>AI and its Moral-Ethical Implications</li>
<li>Reservations about end-all,be-all public-facing promises about AI.</li>
<li>Open-Source Tech</li>
<li>Regulations in AI</li>
<li>… and more, you get the idea though.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

The views I express are solely my own and do not in any way represent any institute, organization, or community I may be associated with, not that you care but still wanted to say it out loud.
